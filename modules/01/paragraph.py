{'original_paragraph': 'By 2020, it was becoming clear that neural AI systems could not perform tasks symbolic systems typically excelled in, such as arithmetic, accessing structured DB data, or making API calls. These tasks require discrete input parameters that allow us to process them reliably according to strict written logic.\n\nIn 2022, researchers at AI21 developed Jurassic-X, an LLM-based "neuro-symbolic architecture." Neuro-symbolic refers to merging the "neural computation" of large language models (LLMs) with more traditional (i.e. symbolic) computation of code.\n\nJurassic-X used the Modular Reasoning, Knowledge, and Language (MRKL) system [3]. The researchers developed MRKL to solve the limitations of LLMs, namely:\n\n- Lack of up-to-date knowledge, whether that is the latest in AI or something as simple as today\'s date.\n- Lack of proprietary knowledge, such as internal company docs or your calendar bookings.\n- Lack of reasoning, i.e. the inability to perform operations that traditional software is good at, like running complex mathematical operations.\n- Lack of ability to generalize. Back in 2022, most LLMs had to be fine-tuned to perform well in a specific domain. This problem is still present today but far less prominent as the SotA models generalize much better and, in the case of MRKL, are able to use tools relatively well (although we could certainly take the MRKL solution to improve tool use performance even today).\n\nMRKL represents one of the earliest forms of what we would now call an agent; it is an LLM (neural computation) paired with executable code (symbolic computation).',
 'edited_paragraph': 'Around 2020, a significant gap emerged in AI capabilities: neural systems struggled with tasks that symbolic systems traditionally handled well, such as complex calculations, database queries, and API integrations. These operations rely on precise, discrete inputs processed through well-defined logic.\n\nIn 2022, AI21 Labs introduced Jurassic-X, a pioneering "neuro-symbolic architecture." This approach merged the advanced pattern recognition of large language models (LLMs) with the structured processing of traditional code.\n\nJurassic-X was built upon the Modular Reasoning, Knowledge, and Language (MRKL) system. The MRKL system was designed to address key limitations observed in LLMs at the time:\n\n*   **Outdated Knowledge:** LLMs lacked real-time information, from current events to simple data like the date.\n*   **Limited Proprietary Access:** They could not access private data such as internal company documents or user calendars.\n*   **Inadequate Reasoning:** LLMs faltered in performing operations requiring strict logic, like mathematical computations.\n*   **Poor Generalization:** Many LLMs required extensive fine-tuning for specific domains. While newer models generalize better, MRKL demonstrated an effective way to improve domain-specific performance through tool use.\n\nMRKL can be seen as an early precursor to modern AI agents, effectively combining an LLM (neural computation) with executable code (symbolic computation).',
